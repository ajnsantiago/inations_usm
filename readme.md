## iNations user management system

A simple and complete project that contains tools to view and manage inations users, groups and create the connections between them.

## A few notes

- The project was build with mandatory login and with different permissions.
- There is only one user with permission to manage the inations users and the groups (add, edit, delete), that user is created in the first DB migration with the following data:
    - Name: admin
    - E-mail: admin@inations.pt
    - Pwd: admin
- All the users that are created using the "register" functionality in the system will only have visual permission to the data.
- This project was build using the latest Laravel version available at the moment
